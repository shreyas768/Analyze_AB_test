# Analyze_AB_test

## Summary
The project consisted of understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and helping the company understand through statistical conclusions, if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Objectives

1. Data cleaning and wrangling, by removing duplicate rows and missing values
2. Perform A/B test, make recommendations and highlight their practical difficulties backed by computed inferences.
3. Perform Hypothesis tests and calculate P-values. With their help, draw inferences.
4. Conduct Logistic Regression
